# Start with a Telegram bot using aiogram.
# On /start, let the user choose: "I'm a business" or "I'm a client".
# If business: register name, type, description, photo.
# If client: use the /start payload (like biz_12345) to show only that business's catalog.
# Route them accordingly and store data using SQLite.
