# Project: Telegram Multi-Business Bot with AI Assistant

## 📌 Goal:
Build a Telegram bot using Python that allows multiple businesses to use a shared bot to automate their service or product offerings. The bot also includes an integrated AI assistant to help both businesses and their clients.

---

## 👤 Business-side features:

- On `/start`, user selects: "I'm a Business" or "I'm a Client"
- If "Business":
  - Register with: business name, type (products/services), contact info
  - Get a unique link: `/start biz_12345`
  - Can manage a personal catalog:
    - Add items manually: name, description, price, image URL
    - Or import via:
      - ✅ Google Sheets (via link + API key or service account)
      - ✅ Excel file (.xlsx or .csv)
- Admin panel (text menu):
  - View / Add / Edit / Delete items
  - Receive client orders/requests
- Optional: limit number of items in free version

---

## 👥 Client-side features:

- When accessing `/start biz_12345`, client sees:
  - Business info (name, logo, description)
  - Catalog of products or services
  - Option to tap "Order" / "Book"
- The bot sends the request to the business owner with client info
- Optional confirmation sent to client

---

## 🧠 AI Integration:

### For Businesses:
- `/ai` command or inline menu: prompts GPT to:
  - Generate product/service descriptions
  - Suggest upsell ideas or offers
  - Answer setup or marketing questions

### For Clients:
- If they tap “Need Help Choosing?” or type a message, AI assistant asks:
  - Gender, height, weight, age (optional)
  - Recommends size or product based on catalog data
  - Explains differences between options

#### Examples:
- "What shampoo should I buy if I have dry scalp?"
- "Which T-shirt fits me if I’m 180cm and 75kg?"
- "What’s the best option for back pain massage?"

### Tech:
- Use OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 via API
- Store key in `.env`
- AI used in both `/ai` for business, and `/advisor` for clients

---

## 📦 Data & Storage:

- Use SQLite (for MVP) or MongoDB
- Each business has:
  - Their own catalog (items/services)
  - Client list
  - Orders

---

## 📂 Suggested file structure:

- `main.py` — core Telegram bot logic
- `handlers/business.py` — business panel
- `handlers/client.py` — client interface
- `ai_helper.py` — GPT integration
- `importer/google_sheets.py` — Google Sheets import
- `importer/excel.py` — Excel import
- `database.py` — DB interaction
- `.env` — API tokens

---

## 🔧 Libraries:

- `aiogram` or `python-telegram-bot`
- `openai`
- `gspread` or `google-api-python-client`
- `pandas`, `openpyxl`
- `python-dotenv`

---

## 🧪 Extra ideas:

- Restrict catalog size for free tier
- Periodic backups
- Order analytics (how many, top products, etc.)
- Referral system (`/start biz_12345?ref=678`)

---

## 🎯 Summary

Create a modular, multi-tenant Telegram bot with AI support for small business owners. Includes flexible catalog setup, import options, custom client links, and AI-powered business & client consulting. MVP should work via SQLite, with an upgrade path for hosting and scaling.

Start with business registration, catalog input (manual + file), client storefronts, and simple GPT prompts. Expand AI logic later.
